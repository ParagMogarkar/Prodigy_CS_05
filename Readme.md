# 🌐 Network Packet Analyzer

A simple Python script to capture and analyze network packets using the powerful `scapy` library. Created as part of the **Prodigy Infotech Internship – Cybersecurity Tasks**.

---

## 💡 How It Works

This script uses `scapy` to **sniff** 10 network packets and displays:
- Source IP address
- Destination IP address
- Protocol number

It's a great way to understand basic network traffic inspection and how packets flow through your system.
